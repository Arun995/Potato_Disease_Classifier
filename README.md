# Potato Classifier

## Overview
The Potato Classifier project is an advanced image classification system designed to identify various types of potatoes. This project employs FastAPI for API management, Docker for containerization, TensorFlow Serving for model serving, Flask for the web framework, and Postman for API testing.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classify images of different types of potatoes.
- **API Integration**: FastAPI handles requests and responses for classification.
- **Containerization**: Docker ensures consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Model Serving**: TensorFlow Serving is used to efficiently serve the machine learning model.
- **Web Framework**: Flask creates a web interface for interacting with the API.
- **Testing**: Postman is used to test and validate the API endpoints.

## Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**: For building and managing the API server.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **TensorFlow Serving**: For serving the machine learning model.
- **Flask**: For developing the web framework.
- **Postman**: For testing the API.
